# Learning Marimo through Advent of Code

My team recently adopted [Marimo](https://marimo.io/) as our primary tool for cleaning and transforming our internal data. We love it. We have been able to make great use of it already, but our adoption has been hindered somewhat by a lack of Python knowledge on the team. Marimo's SQL cells have been sufficient for most of the heavy lifting. However, there is always a rough edge or two on the edges of our notebooks where we need to interface with Python.

This repository serves as a gentle introduction to Python for my team, with a focus on Marimo notebooks. The hope is to turn each AOC challenge into a separate mini lesson that teaches one or more skills that I personally find useful at work. This isn't meant to be exhaustive. Rather, I just want to highlight some of the more common patterns we use with Python and Marimo.

## Running the notebook locally

Clone this repository then run `uv run marimo edit`.
